0,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I'm an old person so if I'm enjoying them this much I'm sure you will too,0.4633862433862434,0.1345796590241035,Positive

110,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

210,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I'm an old person so if I'm enjoying them this much I'm sure you will too,0.4633862433862434,0.1345796590241035,Positive

430,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

550,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

670,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

790,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't.

I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing.

1180,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three.

For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project.

1300,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't.

1690,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project.

1810,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project.

1940,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

2060,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

3710,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

Lately in the last week Alexa can't seem to understand a dang thing either of us say. She comes up with the absolutely stupidest responses not even relevant to what we said.Yoou would think as an AI with the entire internet available you could get halfway decent answers to questions. Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don't work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with.

4370,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

4483,We have multiple Devices - at first we were very pleased but alas it seems Amazon with all it's money can't develop a really decent product. Lately in the last week Alexa can't seem to understand a dang thing either of us say. She comes up with the absolutely stupidest responses not even relevant to what we said.Yoou would think as an AI with the entire internet available you could get halfway decent answers to questions. Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don't work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with.

4910,I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.
