Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I found this very easy to set up.

Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers.

POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out.

The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!!

I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining.

My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet.

You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out.

Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet.

When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work.

Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up?

I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing.

Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next!

You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet.

They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it.

My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP.

The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!!

Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version.

Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature!

But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

I have 3 alexa dots 3rd generation.  Left town for 2 months and when I came back, none of the 3rd generation dots will work.  Spent a plethora of time trying to get them to connect to internet with not luck.  I have 1st and 2nd generation dots that are working with no problem.  Won\\'t make the mistake of buying any amazon products ever again. Hard to use It listens in on private conversation. I hate it!! We have multiple Devices - at first we were very pleased but alas it seems Amazon with all it\\'s money can\\'t develop a really decent product. Lately in the last week Alexa can\\'t seem to understand a dang thing either of us say. She comes up with the absolutely stupidest responses not even relevant to what we said.Yoou would think as an AI with the entire internet available you could get halfway decent answers to questions. Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don\\'t work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with. Goodbye Alexa. Hello Google. Just wonderfully wonderful Why is the Echo dot not compatible with my new Echo Dot Samsung Galaxy Note 4?I have wasted hours of time trying to figure this out....not worth the bitch...trust me! The app is good for some basic automation, and it is the main app I use for the majority of the smart devices I have in the house. There are a lot of improvements that I would suggest, but one that should be done immediately would be to add a \"monthly\" option for reminders. Having to select either 30 or 31 days seriously agitates a persons OCD. I used to be able to sign in on my PC and see what is currently playing on my echo dot when I say \"Alexa play my music everywhere\" now it just wants to connect to my pc microphone which I do not have. love This Alexa Dot \\'nuf said I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next!

I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I have 3 alexa dots 3rd generation.  Left town for 2 months and when I came back, none of the 3rd generation dots will work.  Spent a plethora of time trying to get them to connect to internet with not luck.  I have 1st and 2nd generation dots that are working with no problem.  Won\\'t make the mistake of buying any amazon products ever again. Hard to use It listens in on private conversation. I hate it!! We have multiple Devices - at first we were very pleased but alas it seems Amazon with all it\\'s money can\\'t develop a really decent product. Lately in the last week Alexa can\\'t seem to understand a dang thing either of us say. She comes up with the absolutely stupidest responses not even relevant to what we said.Yoou would think as an AI with the entire internet available you could get halfway decent answers to questions. Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don\\'t work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with. Goodbye Alexa. Hello Google. Just wonderfully wonderful Why is the Echo dot not compatible with my new Echo Dot Samsung Galaxy Note 4?I have wasted hours of time trying to figure this out....not worth the bitch...trust me! The app is good for some basic automation, and it is the main app I use for the majority of the smart devices I have in the house. There are a lot of improvements that I would suggest, but one that should be done immediately would be to add a \"monthly\" option for reminders. Having to select either 30 or 31 days seriously agitates a persons OCD. I used to be able to sign in on my PC and see what is currently playing on my echo dot when I say \"Alexa play my music everywhere\" now it just wants to connect to my pc microphone which I do not have. love This Alexa Dot \\'nuf said I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!

So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I have 3 alexa dots 3rd generation.  Left town for 2 months and when I came back, none of the 3rd generation dots will work.  Spent a plethora of time trying to get them to connect to internet with not luck.  I have 1st and 2nd generation dots that are working with no problem.  Won\\'t make the mistake of buying any amazon products ever again. Hard to use It listens in on private conversation. I hate it!! We have multiple Devices - at first we were very pleased but alas it seems Amazon with all it\\'s money can\\'t develop a really decent product. Lately in the last week Alexa can\\'t seem to understand a dang thing either of us say. She comes up with the absolutely stupidest responses not even relevant to what we said.Yoou would think as an AI with the entire internet available you could get halfway decent answers to questions. Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don\\'t work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with. Goodbye Alexa. Hello Google. Just wonderfully wonderful Why is the Echo dot not compatible with my new Echo Dot Samsung Galaxy Note 4?I have wasted hours of time trying to figure this out....not worth the bitch...trust me! The app is good for some basic automation, and it is the main app I use for the majority of the smart devices I have in the house. There are a lot of improvements that I would suggest, but one that should be done immediately would be to add a \"monthly\" option for reminders. Having to select either 30 or 31 days seriously agitates a persons OCD. I used to be able to sign in on my PC and see what is currently playing on my echo dot when I say \"Alexa play my music everywhere\" now it just wants to connect to my pc microphone which I do not have. love This Alexa Dot \\'nuf said I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go.

It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I have 3 alexa dots 3rd generation.  Left town for 2 months and when I came back, none of the 3rd generation dots will work.  Spent a plethora of time trying to get them to connect to internet with not luck.  I have 1st and 2nd generation dots that are working with no problem.  Won\\'t make the mistake of buying any amazon products ever again. Hard to use It listens in on private conversation. I hate it!! We have multiple Devices - at first we were very pleased but alas it seems Amazon with all it\\'s money can\\'t develop a really decent product. Lately in the last week Alexa can\\'t seem to understand a dang thing either of us say. She comes up with the absolutely stupidest responses not even relevant to what we said.Yoou would think as an AI with the entire internet available you could get halfway decent answers to questions. Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don\\'t work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with. Goodbye Alexa. Hello Google. Just wonderfully wonderful Why is the Echo dot not compatible with my new Echo Dot Samsung Galaxy Note 4?I have wasted hours of time trying to figure this out....not worth the bitch...trust me! The app is good for some basic automation, and it is the main app I use for the majority of the smart devices I have in the house. There are a lot of improvements that I would suggest, but one that should be done immediately would be to add a \"monthly\" option for reminders. Having to select either 30 or 31 days seriously agitates a persons OCD. I used to be able to sign in on my PC and see what is currently playing on my echo dot when I say \"Alexa play my music everywhere\" now it just wants to connect to my pc microphone which I do not have. love This Alexa Dot \\'nuf said I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator?

Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don\\'t work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with. Goodbye Alexa. Hello Google. Just wonderfully wonderful Why is the Echo dot not compatible with my new Echo Dot Samsung Galaxy Note 4?I have wasted hours of time trying to figure this out....not worth the bitch...trust me! The app is good for some basic automation, and it is the main app I use for the majority of the smart devices I have in the house. There are a lot of improvements that I would suggest, but one that should be done immediately would be to add a \"monthly\" option for reminders. Having to select either 30 or 31 days seriously agitates a persons OCD. I used to be able to sign in on my PC and see what is currently playing on my echo dot when I say \"Alexa play my music everywhere\" now it just wants to connect to my pc microphone which I do not have. love This Alexa Dot \\'nuf said I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I have 3 alexa dots 3rd generation.  Left town for 2 months and when I came back, none of the 3rd generation dots will work.  Spent a plethora of time trying to get them to connect to internet with not luck.  I have 1st and 2nd generation dots that are working with no problem.  Won\\'t make the mistake of buying any amazon products ever again. Hard to use It listens in on private conversation. I hate it!! We have multiple Devices - at first we were very pleased but alas it seems Amazon with all it\\'s money can\\'t develop a really decent product. Lately in the last week Alexa can\\'t seem to understand a dang thing either of us say.

Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I have 3 alexa dots 3rd generation.  Left town for 2 months and when I came back, none of the 3rd generation dots will work.  Spent a plethora of time trying to get them to connect to internet with not luck.  I have 1st and 2nd generation dots that are working with no problem.  Won\\'t make the mistake of buying any amazon products ever again. Hard to use It listens in on private conversation. I hate it!! We have multiple Devices - at first we were very pleased but alas it seems Amazon with all it\\'s money can\\'t develop a really decent product. Lately in the last week Alexa can\\'t seem to understand a dang thing either of us say. She comes up with the absolutely stupidest responses not even relevant to what we said.Yoou would think as an AI with the entire internet available you could get halfway decent answers to questions. Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don\\'t work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with. Goodbye Alexa. Hello Google. Just wonderfully wonderful Why is the Echo dot not compatible with my new Echo Dot Samsung Galaxy Note 4?I have wasted hours of time trying to figure this out....not worth the bitch...trust me! The app is good for some basic automation, and it is the main app I use for the majority of the smart devices I have in the house. There are a lot of improvements that I would suggest, but one that should be done immediately would be to add a \"monthly\" option for reminders. Having to select either 30 or 31 days seriously agitates a persons OCD. I used to be able to sign in on my PC and see what is currently playing on my echo dot when I say \"Alexa play my music everywhere\" now it just wants to connect to my pc microphone which I do not have. love This Alexa Dot \\'nuf said I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do.

Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already. It was very easy to set up and had all my reminders and alarms within 10 minutes of set up. Ike weather report and music Still needs lots of work. The app Is slow and has issues especially when using the app and not voice. There is a known issue with drop in as well especially between 2  fire tablets. Only works when one is on show mode?! Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I have 3 alexa dots 3rd generation.  Left town for 2 months and when I came back, none of the 3rd generation dots will work.  Spent a plethora of time trying to get them to connect to internet with not luck.  I have 1st and 2nd generation dots that are working with no problem.  Won\\'t make the mistake of buying any amazon products ever again. Hard to use It listens in on private conversation. I hate it!! We have multiple Devices - at first we were very pleased but alas it seems Amazon with all it\\'s money can\\'t develop a really decent product. Lately in the last week Alexa can\\'t seem to understand a dang thing either of us say. She comes up with the absolutely stupidest responses not even relevant to what we said.Yoou would think as an AI with the entire internet available you could get halfway decent answers to questions. Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don\\'t work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with. Goodbye Alexa. Hello Google. Just wonderfully wonderful Why is the Echo dot not compatible with my new Echo Dot Samsung Galaxy Note 4?I have wasted hours of time trying to figure this out....not worth the bitch...trust me! The app is good for some basic automation, and it is the main app I use for the majority of the smart devices I have in the house. There are a lot of improvements that I would suggest, but one that should be done immediately would be to add a \"monthly\" option for reminders. Having to select either 30 or 31 days seriously agitates a persons OCD. I used to be able to sign in on my PC and see what is currently playing on my echo dot when I say \"Alexa play my music everywhere\" now it just wants to connect to my pc microphone which I do not have. love This Alexa Dot \\'nuf said I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10.

Easy to use, give lots of convenience to every day life Don\\'t mind Alexa as a unit...but will never buy another one until that annoying latest commercial goes away I think I down loaded an older version. Then I received an update. I like Alexa no matter what version. Poor marketing platform thinly disguised as remote assistant.  Software buggy.  Makes beeps for reasons unknown to tech support but apparently having to do with wifi range.  Trashy and if they have market share they hardly deserve it. Fun and easy, essential I think this is a very good software/hardware combo that opens up so many possibilities. I feel as if science fiction has come alive here in my house and hand.  I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient. No suggestions when it doesn\\'t know how to do something or give better direc tions where to go. This, paired with the Amazon Echo , used to be amazing and easy to use but some douche canoe decided to change that. Can y\\'all go back on quarantine and quit screwing my stuff up? Thaaaanks good product I am glad I did. My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she\\'s just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature! It\\'s pretty good, don\\'t have any issues. I really like good old you know who. But I  try not to say her name, to many unnecessary conversations. But, of the other two Stars I think I\\'ll save them for some good updates. It\\'s like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I have 3 alexa dots 3rd generation.  Left town for 2 months and when I came back, none of the 3rd generation dots will work.  Spent a plethora of time trying to get them to connect to internet with not luck.  I have 1st and 2nd generation dots that are working with no problem.  Won\\'t make the mistake of buying any amazon products ever again. Hard to use It listens in on private conversation. I hate it!! We have multiple Devices - at first we were very pleased but alas it seems Amazon with all it\\'s money can\\'t develop a really decent product. Lately in the last week Alexa can\\'t seem to understand a dang thing either of us say. She comes up with the absolutely stupidest responses not even relevant to what we said.Yoou would think as an AI with the entire internet available you could get halfway decent answers to questions. Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don\\'t work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with. Goodbye Alexa. Hello Google. Just wonderfully wonderful Why is the Echo dot not compatible with my new Echo Dot Samsung Galaxy Note 4?I have wasted hours of time trying to figure this out....not worth the bitch...trust me! The app is good for some basic automation, and it is the main app I use for the majority of the smart devices I have in the house. There are a lot of improvements that I would suggest, but one that should be done immediately would be to add a \"monthly\" option for reminders. Having to select either 30 or 31 days seriously agitates a persons OCD. I used to be able to sign in on my PC and see what is currently playing on my echo dot when I say \"Alexa play my music everywhere\" now it just wants to connect to my pc microphone which I do not have. love This Alexa Dot \\'nuf said I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don\\'t always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won\\'t. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won\\'t. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that\\'s a rational so I don\\'t but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I\\'m in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it\\'s summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I\\'m an old person so if I\\'m enjoying them this much I\\'m sure you will too Not reliable, works one day then not the next! I love Alexa dot, she reminds me when to take my meds, wakes me up in the morning. Makes calls for me, just say drop in to  name. Alexa sounds like a real person, I say Thank you and she replys you bet.She recognizes our voices,easy to use. And informs us when a package is at our front door. Can\\'t do without her. Given th high amount of functions this app offers, it is still very straightforward to use. Love it, I\\'m sure Alexa does too :D Alexa app is inconsistent in performance. Needs work. Can use only basic stuff, time, alarm weather.  News is always one day behind. Can not  search the web for current info. Can see can feed on echo but stopped working recently on fire tablet. Getting live view not supported message Quit working?? Alexa displays red and tries to set up but fails now for days. There is not APP anywhere for Windows 10. Is a excellent Amazon Alexa Not working on my fire tv why Once you start playing music it won\\'t stop no matter how many times you say Alexa. You have to pick the speaker up and hold it to your lips and shout at it.  It plays the wrong song and artist about half the time. Alex doesn\\'t respond alot of time I have to repeat myself like she is hard hearing. Then she has been unable to recognized my voice and I have to keep going in to app to correct it. I hardly think I have a voice like my son. My daughter got it for me so I would not be lonely around the house while everyone was at work. I could talk to her and have her play music . When I ask her simple questions. Still she is better to have around than nothing at all. I have her play soft instrumental music for the cats when I\\'m out. They like it and provides a relaxing enviroment for them. Worse app I have ever tried. Absolutely useless. Works fantastic Seemless integration between devices and with Kasa app and smartplugs. Awesome.  And we love the reminders as well. Keeps everyone on track. Easy to use.. I wish I bought it sooner.. Alexa used to reply with voice but stopped. Why ???? Works well Why does it KEEP. POPPING UP. Especially when I plug in my headphones. For now i shall rate this one star, if it is fixed only then i will change my mind. Easy to use and hands free! I liked product. Its entertaining. My wife enjoys the unit. Great as a hands free phone accessory Love Alexa! We use her for everything from playing music, setting alarms, to telling my family jokes!  We love the assistance she provides & ease of setup on multiple devices! Technology makes life easier! Christmas gift from our kids. We love it!!!! I find the app extremely slow. sorry setting this up and downloading this app sucks, I love the Alexa Echo Dot. It has my whole schedule already.

I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can\\'t find it. It works like a charm! Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books. I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election? haven\\'t seen the benefit Wouldn\\'t download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn\\'t free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned. Doesn\\'t work, won\\'t start up? The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again... I have 3 alexa dots 3rd generation.  Left town for 2 months and when I came back, none of the 3rd generation dots will work.  Spent a plethora of time trying to get them to connect to internet with not luck.  I have 1st and 2nd generation dots that are working with no problem.  Won\\'t make the mistake of buying any amazon products ever again. Hard to use It listens in on private conversation. I hate it!! We have multiple Devices - at first we were very pleased but alas it seems Amazon with all it\\'s money can\\'t develop a really decent product. Lately in the last week Alexa can\\'t seem to understand a dang thing either of us say. She comes up with the absolutely stupidest responses not even relevant to what we said.Yoou would think as an AI with the entire internet available you could get halfway decent answers to questions. Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don\\'t work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with. Goodbye Alexa. Hello Google. Just wonderfully wonderful Why is the Echo dot not compatible with my new Echo Dot Samsung Galaxy Note 4?I have wasted hours of time trying to figure this out....not worth the bitch...trust me! The app is good for some basic automation, and it is the main app I use for the majority of the smart devices I have in the house. There are a lot of improvements that I would suggest, but one that should be done immediately would be to add a \"monthly\" option for reminders. Having to select either 30 or 31 days seriously agitates a persons OCD. I used to be able to sign in on my PC and see what is currently playing on my echo dot when I say \"Alexa play my music everywhere\" now it just wants to connect to my pc microphone which I do not have. love This Alexa Dot \\'nuf said'"

I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I'm an old person so if I'm enjoying them this much I'm sure you will too\n",

For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

            "681) I found this very easy to set up. I like the first one so much that I ended up getting two more when Amazon had them on special. I now have three. I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close. I'm an old person so if I'm enjoying them this much I'm sure you will too\n",

I configured them singly two of them upstairs and then later the third one down stairs. I do get frustrated that they don't always do what I tell them to do. For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

For instance if I asked that a song be skipped it gets Alexa gets confused. One of them will do it in the other two won't. Or worse I will tell Alexa to shut the music down and one will and the others won't. I find myself wanting to argue with them like they are teenagers. I know that's a rational so I don't but that is the frustrating thing. On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

On the other hand the sound is great I love that I can set timers I can ask what time it is what the weather is like and so forth right when I'm in the middle of cooking or doing a project. Very very convenient. Now that it's summer I can put them in the window sills and sit out at the fire pit and control music from there. Not as good as having the trees wired but pretty close.

I am not sure my wife is pleased with my love of the Drop In and Announce functions.  Maybe I call out to her a bit too much! You have control over a single device or a network of devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network) that allows multi-room capabilities that makes life a little more convenient.\n",

            "2823) My whole family should be able to control smart devices connected to our alexa, however only the account that setup the device (mine )is able to control them. So if im asleep and my wife wants to turn on an alexa bulb she either wakes me up talking to alexa, or she's just screwed! even whisper mode still makes loud confirmation beeps which wake me or our baby up....Severely lacking this MAJOR feature!\n",

            "\n",
            "2826) It's like having a butler, a secretary and a personal d.j. I am using a donated echo dot and I am technology challenged, but I figured out how to hook it up.And best of all, I ask her to call my phone when I can't find it. It works like a charm!\n",
            "\n",
            "2827) Alexa has only my voice to deal with and when I have to ask repeatedly for the same podcast, something is amiss. It would be good if she could benefit from her errors. She does not, but repeats them ad infinitum. On the other hand, the audio is excellent and it interfaces well with reading the Kindle books.\n",
            "\n",
            "2828) I cannot install this app on my new tablet. Amazon is preventing me from doing so. All related to their Fire Tablet and a monopoly. I deeply resent this. I am a good customer, buying 90% of my supplies and everything else from Amazon. I wanted to stop using my phone with Alexa and get rid of it, but Amazon will not let me. I wonder how Walmart.com is doing? And my congressman and senator? All running for re-election?\n",
            "\n",
            "2829) Wouldn't download the Alexa app to my phone, stating it did not have enough space on my SD Card, however I have a 256gb micro in my phone with only 30gb used.Tried the app on my PC and that is when the mouse went crazy, like it was being controlled by someone else.  It was opening all kinds of programs on my computer without me touching it.We already have Google equipment in our house and I never would have tried this Echo if it wasn't free from Sirius XM.  Lesson learned.\n",
            "\n",
            "2830) The Alexa app will only work with the latest iPhones, tablets and Android devices, which can accept the latest operating systems.  It was specifically designed to NOT work with earlier versions.  What this means is that in order for this to work, you will need to buy a newer tablet or phone, which will accept the latest OS.  That makes this \"free\" app a very expensive product indeed.  And to make matters worse, Alexa products simply will not work without it, so if you have spent money for those products, expecting a plug and play experience, think again...\n",
            "\n",
            "2831) We have multiple Devices - at first we were very pleased but alas it seems Amazon with all it's money can't develop a really decent product. Lately in the last week Alexa can't seem to understand a dang thing either of us say. She comes up with the absolutely stupidest responses not even relevant to what we said.Yoou would think as an AI with the entire internet available you could get halfway decent answers to questions. Besides the fact that information is horrible Alexa lacks even the slightest hint of any personality if you will.Now on the technical end there are several devices that says Alexa compatible and approve dthat don't work for one reason or another - case in point Feit light bulbs along with other items that only work with 2.4 ghz now I ave a combined network on a smart router that deliver 5 and 2.4 through the same SSID but alas Alexa and her Echo devices connect to the 5 Ghz and refuse steadfastly to recognize a device connected via 2.4 even though they are on the same SSID???Serious work needs to be done with Alexa and it appears Amazon has no interest in doing anything but what they think we should be happy with. Goodbye Alexa. Hello Google.\n",
            "\n",
            "2832) Just wonderfully wonderful\n",
            "\n",
            "2833) Why is the Echo dot not compatible with my new Echo Dot Samsung Galaxy Note 4?I have wasted hours of time trying to figure this out....not worth the bitch...trust me!\n",
            "\n",
            "2834) The app is good for some basic automation, and it is the main app I use for the majority of the smart devices I have in the house. There are a lot of improvements that I would suggest, but one that should be done immediately would be to add a \"monthly\" option for reminders. Having to select either 30 or 31 days seriously agitates a persons OCD.\n",
            "\n",
            "2835) I used to be able to sign in on my PC and see what is currently playing on my echo dot when I say \"Alexa play my music everywhere\" now it just wants to connect to my pc microphone which I do not have.\n",
