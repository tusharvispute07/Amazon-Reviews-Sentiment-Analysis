Amazon Alexa, Also known as Alexa, is a virtual assistant built with artificial intelligence. It is an interactive voice assistant available on amazon's lineup of Echo speakers, smart thermostats, soundbars, lamps and lights, and right on our phones through the alexa app. Alexa can do quick math for you, play your favourite song, check news and weather and control many of our home's smart products.

Product revierws are becoming more and more important with the evolution of traditional brick and motar retail stores to online shopping. So it has become very essential to detect and understand customer feelings about a particular product. In this project, I've performed a Sentiment Analysis on the product reviews of Alexa. The reviews are scraped from the amazon's website and stored in a csv file. For doing the analysis if have used Textblob to get the sentiment and calculate the polarity and subjectivity of the reviews.
